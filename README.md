# W_hotbox
A hotbox for Nuke similar to the one found in Autodesk Maya.


## Introduction Tutorial

**W_hotbox** is basically a fully customisable *favourites menu* that pops up for as long as you press the shortcut and disappears as soon as you release. The buttons that make up the menu represent python scripts and change depending on you selection. The **Hotbox Manager** offers you an user friendly interface which allows you to add new buttons on the fly. Those buttons are directly accessible via buttons that appear in the menu under your cursor.

You have the option to create buttons that either show up when specific node (combinations) are selected, as well as buttons that will show up no matter what is currently selected.

Here is the hotbox while having a Merge node selected:

For me it changed the way I interact with Nuke completely and it sped up my workflow quite a bit. The ability to move any action to a button that appears near your cursor saves you a trip to the other side of your screen and back pretty often.

Besides that I use it a lot to automate repetitive tasks and actions I would otherwise probably not have taken time for at all. (Think of things that make your script more readable, but don't necessarily contribute to the final image, like (color)labeling nodes.).

However, you can add whatever buttons you like, so it's totally up to you how you put the hotbox to use.

 The Manager, an interface to add and modify buttons on the fly:

The download includes a user guide that features an in-depth description of everything there is to know about the hotbox. It also includes an installation guide and some basic python examples. Besides that, the download also comes with a bundle of buttons you can choose to install, so you don't have to start from scratch.

To upgrade from an older version, simply replace the old ‘W_hotbox.py’ and ‘W_hotboxManager.py’ with their updated versions.<br></span></p>

If you decide to install the tool in a studio environment I would love to hear which studio! (Just because I think that's a fun thing to know :) )
